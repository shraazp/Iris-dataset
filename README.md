# Analysis of Iris flower dataset using KNN Classification

The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

Information about the original paper and usages of the dataset can be found in the http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Just for reference, here are pictures of the three flowers species:

K Nearest Neighbor(KNN) is a very simple, easy to understand, versatile and one of the topmost machine learning algorithms. KNN used in the variety of applications such as finance, healthcare, political science, handwriting detection, image recognition and video recognition. In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or wonâ€™t vote. KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. KNN algorithm based on feature similarity approach.
